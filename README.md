phototimer - create timelapses with your Raspberry Pi
==========

phototimer gives you a smart way to capture photos for your timelapses. It is smart because it only takes pictures between the hours you specify and creates a useful folder structure. It is simple because it only depends on Python and `raspistill` both of which are normally already available.

How does it work?
------------------

Start phototimer through a terminal, `ssh` connection or `@reboot crontab` specifying the amount of seconds between photos after that. By default photos are stored in `/mnt/usbflash`, but this is configurable along with daylight hours and the quality level of the photos.

This is an example `config.py` file which should create files that are about 2MB in size:

```python
config = {}
config["am"] = 400
config["pm"] = 2000

config["flip_horizontal"] = True
config["flip_vertical"] = False
config["metering_mode"] = "matrix"

config["base_path"] = "/var/image"
config["height"] = 1536
config["width"] = 2048
config["quality"] = 35
```


Usage
-----
```
$ python take.py 60 &
```

This will takes a photo every 60 seconds. The default base folder is /mnt/usbflash, photos are then put in a folder such as:
Output file format
-----------------
    /2014/11/20/762132131.jpg
    /yyyy/mm/hh/milliseconds

* Default hours to take images is between 7am and 5pm + 1 hour either side
* Designed to be run constantly - with the quality settings this equates to about 1gb of JPG images per day


Troubleshooting
---------------
If you find that phototimer is automatically exiting then you may want to use a tool like `screen` to make sure you can keep an eye on the process.

```
$ screen
$ cd phototimer
$ python2 take.py 60
[Control A + D]
```

To reconnect later type in `screen -r`.

Unit testing
------------

The exposure calculations and some other functions have been unit tested, if you change the code or want to extend it please look at these before contributing.

Here's how you run them:

```
chmod 700 ./run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
```
